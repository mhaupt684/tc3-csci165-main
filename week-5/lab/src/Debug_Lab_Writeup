Debug Lab Writeup

4. DebuggingExercise.java
WHAT ISSUE - Run the debugger and main() is throwing ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException  (id=19)	
HOW - eclipse automatically catches NullPointerExceptions by adding breakpoint exception
WHAT FIX - the for loops were running n+1 the size of the array, causing it to go out of bounds. Reduce number of times the loop runs.

5. DebugHash.java - 49,791st hash value: 2a84296c6a45c4734bbe39beebb670ea
WHAT ISSUE - infinite loop, needs to be stopped when the 49,791st hash code is created
HOW - set the hit count to 49791, so that debugger stops once the while loop has run 49,791 times

6. FibDebug.java - 
WHAT ISSUE - The following method intends to compute the n-th Fibonacci number, but contains a bug 
HOW - set the debugger to stop when the fib method is called, step through to see what is going wrong
WHAT FIX - change the while loop to n > 2, because you are already accounting for f1 and only need to run 14 times

7. Marker.java -
WHAT ISSUE -  only one message should be printed, all are being printed
HOW - set the debugger to stop when the method is called, watch and see why it's printing everything
WHAT FIX - change from all if statements to if, else if, else statements

8. Account.java/Account Debug.java -
WHAT ISSUE - Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NullPointerException at AccountDebug.main(AccountDebug.java:6)
HOW - the debugger suggests that Account a cannot be null
WHAT FIX - look at the constructor and see what needs to be provided. The constructor needs a string - Account a = new Account("Michael"); 

9. Person.java/Person Debug.java -
WHAT ISSUE - Error: Could not find or load main class AccountDebug Caused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: AccountDebug
Also , the constructor is undefined
HOW - set a break point when you are creating an instance of a class and then step into the class.
WHAT FIX - change variables in the constructor to have this. instead of defining a new variable. Change second getName in  print statement to get Age
